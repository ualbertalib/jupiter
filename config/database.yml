  # TODO: Review this later
  # This is a temporary fix for docker with using DATABASE_URL environment variable,
  # rails 5 will provision both dev and test database when running db:* rake tasks but it only uses the DATABASE_URL
  # for the dev database. A fix for this is upstream in rails here https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/28933
  # More information can be found here: https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/28827

# As with config/secrets.yml, you never want to store sensitive information,
# like your database password, in your source code. If your source code is
# ever seen by anyone, they now have access to your database.
#
# Instead, provide the password as a unix environment variable when you boot
# the app. Read http://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#configuring-a-database
# for a full rundown on how to provide these environment variables in a
# production deployment.
#
# On Heroku and other platform providers, you may have a full connection URL
# available as an environment variable. For example:
#
#   DATABASE_URL="mysql2://myuser:mypass@localhost/somedatabase"
#
# You can use this database configuration with:
#
#   production:
#     url: <%= ENV['DATABASE_URL'] %>
#
uat:
  url: <%= Rails.application.secrets.database_url %>
staging:
  url: <%= Rails.application.secrets.database_url %>
production:
  url: <%= Rails.application.secrets.database_url %>
