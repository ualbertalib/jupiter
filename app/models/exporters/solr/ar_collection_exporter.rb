  # but using +additional_search_index+ to store data that isn't recreatable solely by inspecting this object's
  # Fedora record creates data-ordering issues that are complicated to work around during Solr-index recovery
  # scenarios. See recover.rake for information on the particular problems this is causing and why we want to
  # eliminate it.
