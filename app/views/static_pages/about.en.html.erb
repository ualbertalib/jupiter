  <h3>What Is ERA?</h3>

  <p>
    ERA (Education and Research Archive) is the name for University of Alberta's Digital Asset Management
    strategy, being developed and supported by the
    <a href="http://www.library.ualberta.ca">University of Alberta Libraries</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    ERA's open access content includes the intellectual output of the University and promotes global
    opportunities for research discovery as well as for archival preservation.
    ERA also provides an easy and convenient solution for faculty who must deposit their research in an
    open access repository to meet funding agency requirements, such as the Tri-Agency Open Access Policy
    on Publications. We can deposit items on behalf of researchers through our mediated deposit service,
    or researchers can deposit their items using our easy self-deposit process.
