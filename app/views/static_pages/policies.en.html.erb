  <h2 id="content-policy">ERA Content Policy</h2>

  <p>
ERA preserves and makes accessible material related to research and teaching, at the University of Alberta and partner institutions. By providing an open access environment for researchers to self-archive and share their research, ERA enables compliance with the <a href="http://www.science.gc.ca/eic/site/063.nsf/eng/h_F6765465.html">Tri-Agency Open Access Policy on Publications</a>. Canadian researchers whose home institution does not currently maintain an institutional repository can deposit their research with ERA, which is designated as an adoptive repository by the Canadian Association of Research Libraries (contact <a href="mailto:eraadmi@ualberta.ca">eraadmi@ualberta.ca</a> to get started). Undergraduate student work must be vetted by a Faculty or Department or through consultation with the Head, Digital Repositories and Research Data Management before deposit in ERA.
  </p>

  <p>
    ERA provides a mediated deposit service which can help researchers determine if their material is appropriate for deposit, will provide support in determining licensing and publisher permissions, and carries out deposits on behalf of researchers. Please <%= link_to 'contact us', contact_path %> for help.
  </p>

  <p>
    ERA Contains:
  </p>
<ul>
  <li>Books</li>
  <li>Book Chapters</li>
  <li>Conference/Workshop Posters</li>
  <li>Conference/Workshop Presentations</li>
  <li>Datasets - a group of files associated with research that often include a data file, a codebook, or other forms of data; many images in ERA are classified as data</li>
  <li>Journal Articles (Draft-submitted) – these are sometimes called pre-prints</li>
  <li>Journal Articles (Final, peer-reviewed manuscript) – these are sometimes called post-prints</li>
  <li>Journal Articles (Published version) – check SHERPA-RoMEO for journals allowing this type of deposit</li>
  <li>Learning Objects - syllabus, class Power Point presentation, practice exam, etc.</li>
  <li>Reports</li>
  <li>Research Materials – items such as an images, field notebooks, etc. that don't fall into the other categories</li>
  <li>Reviews - book review, data review, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="eligibility">Eligibility: Who May Deposit Items?</h2>

<p>
Members of the University of Alberta community with a valid CCID may deposit items in ERA. Others may request deposit support from the ERA HelpDesk if their content is determined to be in scope for the service. Contact <a href="mailto:eraadmi@ualberta.ca">eraadmi@ualberta.ca</a> to learn more about our mediated deposit service and training sessions. View our <%= link_to 'policies', '#content-policy' %> for guidelines around depositing content.
</p>

  <h2 id="take-down-policy">ERA Take-Down Policy</h2>

  <p>
The removal of an item from ERA once it is deposited is generally discouraged. However, items will be temporarily taken down under the following scenarios until a determination is made to either restore or permanently remove the item:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>A copyright dispute emerges requiring investigation.</li>
    <li>There is disagreement among multiple authors/creators over whether the item should be placed in ERA. It is in the best interests of depositors to seek co-author permission prior to deposit.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Items will be removed immediately if: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>We become aware of any illegal activity facilitated by an item in ERA.</li>
    <li>An ERA item is used for internet nuisance activity by a user, such as to spam others.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    From time to time, new digital environments emerge which are more well-suited to content which has been deposited in ERA. When this occurs, we will work with depositors and communities to create successful migration experiences to these new environments and ensure that our Library's commitment to outstanding service guides our work. We will always weigh these decisions carefully and design migration plans in consideration of any affected end-users and communities.
  </p>

  <h2 id="metadata-quality">Metadata Quality Policy</h2>

  <p>
    Detailed policy and practice workflows exist to ensure that ERA metadata (the terminology we use to describe individual records in ERA) is of the highest possible quality. Metadata already within ERA may undergo enhancement on an ad-hoc or project basis, and we reserve the right to correct metadata as needed. This allows for optimal collation, dissemination, and preservation of ERA content. <%= link_to 'Contact us', contact_path %> for more information.
  </p>

  <h2 id="digital-preservation">Digital Preservation Statement for ERA</h2>

  <p>
    UAL employs a number of strategies to ensure the preservation of digital material within ERA. Preservation is about more than just keeping a backup copy. It requires a commitment to monitoring and actively maintaining the content so that future generations will be able to find, discover and use today’s digital material regardless of changes to formats and technologies. Our strategies are informed by relevant standards and community best practices. For a summary of our practices please see our UAL Digital Preservation Practices document.
