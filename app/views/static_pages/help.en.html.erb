  <h1>How to deposit your research into ERA</h1>

  <h3>Mediated Deposit</h3>

  <p>
    ERA’s mediated deposit service is the easiest way for researchers to deposit their materials into ERA,
    and is the preferred method of deposit. Our trained staff conduct the deposit from start to finish.
    Our process includes investigating publisher permissions for researchers’ publications, and identifying
    those which allow for archiving into our institutional repository. We will also request permission on
    behalf of the researcher for publications that have no clear archiving policies.
  <p>

  <p>
    Please contact the ERA Helpdesk <a href="mailto:erahelp@ualberta.ca">erahelp@ualberta.ca</a> / (780) 492-4359.
    for more information about this service.
