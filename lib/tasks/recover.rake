    # Unfortunately, an inter-object dependency crept into the way we're using +additional_search_index+ in Collection.
    # Collections attempt to retrieve a Community to index its title, without saving that information to Fedora
    # â€“ this creates an ordering dependency between Collections and Communities such that the Community needs to be
    # indexed prior to indexing the Collection.
    #
    # We got lucky in that there are not expected to be a large number of Collections in this phase of Jupiter
    # but this is a good reminder that +additional_search_index+ is not a magical solution to metadata not wanting
    # redundant data stored in Fedora, because Solr-only data that isn't recreatable by inspecting only the given
    # object's Fedora record, and no others, vastly complicate scenarios like this.
    # (if this had been a more complicated ordering dependency between 40,000+ FileSets and Items, we'd be in a very
    # difficult spot right now)
