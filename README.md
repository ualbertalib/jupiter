# Docker
This project comes with a docker setup to easily setup your own local development environment for jupiter in just a few steps.

## Step 1: Make sure you have docker and docker-compose installed:

1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) (Requires version 1.13.0+)
2. [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (Requires version 1.10.0+)

### Still need more help? Check out the following

#### OSX / Windows
- If you are on Mac, check out [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/)
- If you are on Windows, check out [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/)

These will install `docker`, `docker-compose`, and `docker-machine` on your machine.

#### Linux

Use your distribution's package manager to install `docker` and `docker-compose`.

## Step 2: Get Jupiter source code
Clone the Jupiter repository from github:
```shell
git clone git@github.com:ualbertalib/jupiter.git
cd jupiter
```

## Step 3: Start docker and docker compose

To build, create, start and setup your docker containers simply run:
```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

Now that everything is up and running, you can setup the rails database (only need to be done once, this will setup both dev and test databases):
```shell
docker-compose run web rails db:setup
```

## Step 4: Open and view Jupiter!
Now everything is ready, you can go and view Jupiter! Just open your favorite browser and go to the following url:

[localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

(Note: ip address may be different if you are using `docker-machine`)

## Want to run the test suite?

1. Start up all the docker containers, like you did above (if its not already running):

  ```shell
  docker-compose up -d
  ```

2. Setup the test database (if you haven't already from above):
  ```shell
  docker-compose run web rails db:setup
  ```

3. Then you can run the test suite via rspec:
  ```shell
  docker-compose run web rails test
  ```
## Docker compose lightweight edition

If you want to develop in rails locally on your own machine, there is also a `docker-compose.lightweight.yml` provided. This will give you the datastores you require (solr/fedora) and potentially others if you need them (mysql/redis (commented out by default)). Just run:
  ```shell
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.lightweight.yml up -d
  ```
And everything else is how you would normally develop in a rails project.

(See other sections of this README for more information about developing in a rails project environment)

## Common gotchas?
- If your having issues, logs are the best place to first look at what went wrong.

  To check all container logs:

  ```shell
  docker-compose logs
  ```

  Better yet you can check an individual container log by supplying the container name to the previous command. For example if I want to see the web container logs:

  ```shell
  docker-compose logs web
  ```
- If your switching between docker-compose and local development on your machine, you may encounter in weird permissions on files that docker has created (logs/tmp/etc.). Simply just `sudo rm` them.
